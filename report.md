# Addressing Racial Bias in Facial Recognition Technology for Agricultural Labor: A Privacy-Preserving Approach

## Executive Summary

This report presents our analysis and implementation of a bias-mitigated, privacy-preserving facial recognition technology (FRT) prototype for the agricultural sector. Our work addresses the critical but underexplored implications of FRT deployment in agricultural settings, particularly concerning migrant and seasonal farmworkers. The developed Streamlit application allows for bias detection across racial and gender dimensions, quantifies it using established fairness metrics, and implements mitigation techniques that reduce bias across demographic groups.

Our FRT Bias Reduction prototype integrates multiple components:
1. A pretrained FairFace model that provides state-of-the-art facial attribute recognition
2. Bias detection capabilities using AI Fairness 360 to calculate statistical parity and disparate impact
3. Three distinct mitigation strategies that can be applied and compared
4. Homomorphic encryption for privacy preservation, allowing facial analysis without exposing raw biometric data
5. Explainability tools to visualize which facial features influence model decisions

This prototype serves as a proof of concept that ethical AI principles can be integrated into practical applications for the agricultural sector, where power imbalances may otherwise lead to technology being deployed in ways that exacerbate existing inequities.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Facial recognition technology (FRT) is increasingly deployed in agricultural settings for worker identification, attendance tracking, and access control systems. However, while FRT applications in law enforcement, border security, and consumer technology have received significant scrutiny regarding bias and privacy concerns, these issues remain largely unaddressed in agricultural implementations. This oversight is particularly problematic given that agricultural workers—often from marginalized communities, including racial minorities and migrant laborers—are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation and privacy violations.

The AgriTech Audit Report (2023) documented alarming disparities in commercial FRT systems used on U.S. farms, finding false negative rates of 22% for Hispanic workers compared to just 8% for non-Hispanic workers. These technological disparities directly translate to economic harms through wage theft (when workers cannot be properly identified for attendance tracking) and safety risks (when unauthorized access to restricted areas occurs due to misidentification).

### 1.2 Project Objectives

Our project addresses these intersecting concerns through:

1. **Bias Detection and Quantification**: Developing mechanisms to identify and measure racial and gender bias in FRT systems using established fairness metrics including Statistical Parity Difference and Disparate Impact.

2. **Bias Mitigation Implementation**: Implementing and evaluating multiple bias mitigation strategies to improve fairness across demographic groups while maintaining accuracy.

3. **Privacy-Preserving Architecture**: Designing and implementing homomorphic encryption techniques that allow facial analysis without exposing raw biometric data.

4. **Explainability Integration**: Providing visualization tools that reveal which facial features influence model decisions, enhancing transparency and facilitating bias identification.

5. **Prototype Development**: Creating a functional Streamlit application that demonstrates these capabilities in an accessible interface.

### 1.3 Significance and Novelty

Our project makes several novel contributions to addressing bias and privacy concerns in agricultural FRT:

- First prototype specifically designed to demonstrate FRT bias mitigation for agricultural applications
- Implementation of homomorphic encryption for privacy protection in a domain where surveillance concerns are heightened
- Integration of bias detection, mitigation, privacy protection, and explainability in a single application
- Development of an interactive interface that makes complex fairness metrics accessible to non-technical stakeholders

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 FRT in Agriculture: Current Applications

The agricultural sector has witnessed rapid adoption of facial recognition technology, primarily in three areas:

1. **Farmworker Identification and Management**: Systems that track attendance, hours worked, and field access
2. **Livestock Monitoring**: FRT-driven analysis of animal health, behavior, and productivity
3. **Supply Chain Management**: Identity verification for high-security areas of food processing

As Smith et al. (2022) note, these applications are growing rapidly without corresponding attention to potential harms. The ETC Group (2023) documented instances where facial data collected for "productivity tracking" was later shared with third-party insurers, enabling discriminatory premium practices.

### 2.2 Racial Bias in FRT Systems

Extensive research has demonstrated that commercial FRT systems exhibit disparate performance across racial groups. While most research has focused on law enforcement applications, agricultural implementations face similar challenges, often exacerbated by:

- Training data that underrepresents agricultural workers' demographics
- Environmental conditions (outdoor lighting, dust, protective equipment) that affect recognition accuracy differently across skin tones
- Lower regulatory oversight compared to other sectors

The FAO (2021) documented that systems trained predominantly on European phenotypes show significantly lower accuracy when deployed in regions with different racial demographics, including up to 15% lower accuracy in detecting diseases in African cattle breeds—suggesting similar disparities may affect human recognition.

### 2.3 Privacy Vulnerabilities in Agricultural Settings

Agricultural workers face specific privacy vulnerabilities that differ from other contexts:

- Migrant and seasonal workers often lack awareness of data collection practices due to language barriers and limited access to technology education
- Housing arrangements frequently provided by employers create "total surveillance" environments where biometric tracking extends beyond work hours
- Documented citizenship status concerns may prevent workers from exercising data rights

A 2022 survey of agricultural FRT implementations found that 70% of systems lacked basic encryption for biometric databases (Cybersecurity in Agritech, 2022), creating significant security risks.

### 2.4 Bias Mitigation Approaches

Recent advances in bias mitigation for machine learning models provide promising approaches for addressing FRT disparities. Three primary approaches are relevant to our work:

1. **Preprocessing techniques**: Modifying training data to reduce bias before model training
2. **In-processing techniques**: Modifying the learning algorithm to enforce fairness constraints during training
3. **Post-processing techniques**: Adjusting model outputs to achieve fairness after prediction

Our project primarily investigates preprocessing techniques because they can be applied to existing, deployed models without requiring retraining—a practical consideration for agricultural implementations where technical resources may be limited.

### 2.5 Privacy-Preserving Computation

Homomorphic encryption represents a promising approach for privacy-preserving FRT, allowing computations on encrypted data without decryption. While computational complexity has historically limited practical applications, recent advances make lightweight implementations feasible for specific tasks like facial recognition.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 System Architecture

Our FRT Bias Reduction application integrates multiple components to address both bias and privacy concerns:

1. **Facial Recognition Model**: We implemented and adapted the FairFace model (Kärkkäinen & Joo, 2021), a state-of-the-art face attribute dataset designed for balanced race, gender, and age representation.

2. **Bias Detection Module**: We implemented the AI Fairness 360 toolkit to detect and quantify bias using established metrics including Statistical Parity Difference and Disparate Impact.

3. **Bias Mitigation Module**: We integrated three distinct mitigation strategies (Reweighting, Resampling, and Disparate Impact Remover) with comparative evaluation capabilities.

4. **Privacy Preservation Module**: We developed a homomorphic encryption implementation using the CKKS scheme through the TenSEAL library, enabling encrypted inference.

5. **Explainability Module**: We integrated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) visualizations to help users understand which facial features influence model predictions.

6. **Streamlit Interface**: We built an interactive web application to demonstrate these components and make the technology accessible to non-technical users.

### 3.2 Model Selection and Implementation

We selected the FairFace model architecture based on its demonstrated superior performance for diverse racial groups. FairFace uses a ResNet-34 backbone and was pretrained on a racially balanced dataset containing over 100,000 faces across seven race groups: White, Black, East Asian, Southeast Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern, and Latino/Hispanic.

Our implementation includes:

1. A FairFace model adapter that provides a consistent interface for our application
2. Support for both 7-race and 4-race classification models
3. Preprocessing pipelines that handle image normalization and transformation
4. Feature extraction capabilities for privacy-preserving computation

### 3.3 Bias Detection Implementation

Our bias detection module quantifies two key fairness metrics:

1. **Statistical Parity Difference (SPD)**: Measures the difference in selection rates between demographic groups. Mathematically:
   
   SPD = P(Ŷ=1|D=unprivileged) - P(Ŷ=1|D=privileged)
   
   Where Ŷ is the prediction and D is the demographic group. Values close to 0 indicate minimal bias.

2. **Disparate Impact (DI)**: Measures the ratio of selection rates between demographic groups. Mathematically:
   
   DI = P(Ŷ=1|D=unprivileged) / P(Ŷ=1|D=privileged)
   
   Values close to 1.0 indicate minimal bias, with common regulatory thresholds at 0.8.

The implementation converts categorical attributes to numerical values for processing, creating binary datasets for each protected attribute (gender and race) and comparing outcomes across groups.

### 3.4 Bias Mitigation Strategies

We implemented and evaluated three distinct mitigation approaches:

1. **Reweighting**: Assigns weights to different demographic groups to balance their influence:
   - Weight = expected_proportion / observed_proportion
   - Groups with higher representation are downweighted
   - Groups with lower representation are upweighted

2. **Resampling**: Creates a new dataset by selectively sampling from the original data:
   - Oversamples from underrepresented groups
   - Undersamples from overrepresented groups
   - Creates a balanced dataset across protected attributes

3. **Disparate Impact Remover**: Transforms feature values to achieve statistical parity:
   - Modifies data distribution while preserving rank-ordering within groups
   - Maintains the original model architecture
   - Applies a repair level parameter to control transformation aggressiveness

Each mitigation strategy is applied at the dataset level rather than the individual image level, simulating how these techniques would operate in a production environment.

### 3.5 Privacy Preservation Implementation

Our privacy module implements homomorphic encryption using the CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song) scheme, which allows:

1. Encryption of facial feature vectors extracted from images
2. Performance of linear operations (including dot products) on encrypted data
3. Decryption of results without exposing the original feature vectors

The implementation follows a privacy-by-design approach:

1. Feature extraction occurs on the client side
2. Only encrypted feature vectors are transmitted
3. Computation occurs on encrypted data
4. Results remain encrypted until returned to the client
5. Decryption occurs only on the client device

This approach ensures that even if the server is compromised, biometric data remains protected.

### 3.6 Streamlit Application Development

We developed a Streamlit web application to showcase our prototype, including:

1. A user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing facial images
2. Visualizations of bias metrics with interpretable explanations
3. Interactive controls for applying and comparing mitigation strategies
4. Demonstrations of privacy-preserving computation
5. Face filtering utilities to identify and select appropriate images

The application serves as both a demonstration of the technology and an educational tool for understanding bias and privacy concerns in FRT.

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Data Processing

Our application processes facial images through several steps:

1. **Image Upload**: Users can upload standard image formats (JPG, PNG) through the Streamlit interface
2. **Face Detection**: We use MediaPipe for robust face detection and alignment
3. **Feature Extraction**: For the FairFace model, we extract 512-dimensional feature vectors from the penultimate layer
4. **Attribute Prediction**: The model predicts gender, age, and race probabilities
5. **Bias Analysis**: Predictions across multiple images are analyzed for bias detection

For adequate bias detection, the system processes multiple images from a sample directory to gather sufficient data for statistical analysis.

### 4.2 Bias Detection Algorithm

The core algorithm for detecting bias involves:

1. Creating separate datasets for each protected attribute (gender, race)
2. Converting categorical attributes to numerical values
3. Calculating base rates for privileged and unprivileged groups
4. Computing Statistical Parity Difference and Disparate Impact
5. Interpreting these metrics and providing human-readable explanations

The implementation handles edge cases like division by zero and provides appropriate fallbacks when sample sizes are insufficient.

### 4.3 Homomorphic Encryption Implementation

Our privacy-preserving module:

1. Uses the TenSEAL library to implement CKKS homomorphic encryption
2. Encrypts extracted feature vectors using appropriate parameters for security and efficiency
3. Implements a simplified matrix multiplication for encrypted inference
4. Provides benchmarking capabilities to measure encryption overhead
5. Includes a demonstration mode that allows comparing encrypted vs. unencrypted predictions

The implementation focuses on gender prediction as a proof of concept, with potential extensions to age and race prediction.

### 4.4 User Interface Components

The Streamlit application includes:

1. **Home Page**: Introduction to the project and image upload functionality
2. **Bias Detection Page**: Displays individual predictions and dataset-level bias metrics
3. **Privacy Preservation Page**: Demonstrates homomorphic encryption capabilities

## 8. Conclusion

Our FRT Bias Reduction prototype demonstrates that it is both technically feasible and ethically imperative to address racial bias and privacy concerns in facial recognition technologies, particularly for applications in sectors like agriculture where vulnerable populations are affected. By developing an interactive application that integrates bias detection, mitigation, privacy preservation, and explainability, we have created a proof of concept that illustrates how responsible AI can be implemented in practice.

The agricultural sector presents unique challenges for ethical AI implementation due to power imbalances between employers and workers, challenging deployment environments, and demographic considerations. Our work shows that these challenges can be addressed through thoughtful technical design, appropriate governance frameworks, and ongoing evaluation.

Our prototype serves as both a technology demonstration and an educational tool, helping stakeholders understand how bias manifests in FRT systems and how it can be mitigated. By making complex fairness concepts accessible through an interactive interface, we hope to contribute to more informed discussions about the responsible deployment of facial recognition technology in agricultural and other contexts.

As facial recognition technology continues to proliferate across sectors, this work provides a template for how domain-specific implementations can address the particular risks and requirements of their contexts, rather than applying one-size-fits-all approaches to bias mitigation and privacy protection.
